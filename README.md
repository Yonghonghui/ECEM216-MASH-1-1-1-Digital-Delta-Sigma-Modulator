# ECEM216-MASH-1-1-1-Digital-Delta-Sigma-Modulator
Designed and synthesized a high-speed MASH-1-1-1 Digital Delta-Sigma Modulator targeting a 500MHz clock frequency using the TSMC 16nm FinFET technology library. The project involved complete RTL design, multi-corner synthesis using Synopsys Design Compiler, and sign-off quality power/timing analysis using PrimeTime PX.
